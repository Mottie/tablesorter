tablesorter is a jQuery plugin for turning a standard HTML table with THEAD and TBODY tags into a sortable table without page refreshes.
tablesorter can successfully parse and sort many types of data including linked data in a cell.

  * See the [demo here](http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-option-textsorter-semver.html).
  * This demo does not use a custom parser nor widget, it requires a modified [`semver.js` for node](https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver) file to sort the column using the `textSorter` option.

  * Extra code is also included to highlight invalid semantic versions within the table.

#### <a name="v2.14.2">Version 2.14.2</a> (11/25/2013)

* Removed Bootstrap filter cell background color. Fixes [issue #425](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/425).

* Grouping widget
  * Invalid group class now fails silently.
  * Fixes [issue #438](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/438).

#### <a name="v2.14.1">Version 2.14.1</a> (11/22/2013)

  * External inputs bound using the filter `bindSearch` function now clear on the "filterReset" event.
  * Replace `Array.indexOf()` due to IE8.

#### <a name="v2.14.0">Version 2.14.0</a> (11/19/2013)

**Core**
* Changed sorting algorithms:
  * Due to problems with sorting multiple columns improperly sorting algorithms again include code to sort empty cells.
  * Internal sorting again has separate ascending and descending functions; but the previous `$.tablesorter.sortNatural` (ascending only), `$.tablesorter.sortNumeric` (ascending only) and `$.tablesorter.sortText` (ascending only) functions are still available.
  * Custom text &amp; numeric sort functions, added via `textSorter` and `numberSorter` options now require you to return the sort in the correct direction.
  * Custom sort functions no longer have empty cells automatically handled for you.
  * Fixes [issue #419](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/419).
* Added `sortStable` option which when `true` will sort exactly equal items by placing them in their original unsorted order (or, perform a [stable sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_sort#Stability)).
* Removed double icon class names.
* Added `tabIndex` option
  * When `true`, a tabindex is added to the headers for keyboard accessibility; this was previously always applied
  * When `false`, table headers will not be included when tabbing through the page
  * Fulfills [issue #415](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/415).

**Filter widget**
* Setting a filter to build a select no longer causes an error. Fixes [issue #421](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/421).
* Added `filter_saveFilters` option
  * When `true`, this option saves the current filters using the storage utility (local storage with cookie fallback).
  * This option is set to `false` by default.
  * See [issue #388](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/388).
* Allow multiple external filter inputs
  * The `$.tablesorter.filter.bindSearch( $table, $external )` function now allows binding searches using the built-in functioning.
  * The bind search function will unbind any previously bound `keyup` and `search` event listeners on the `$external` elements.
  * External inputs must not have a `tablesorter-filter` class to distinguish them from internal filters.
  * If not using the `filter_anyMatch` option, external filters can be set to target specific columns by including a `data-column` attribute.
  * See the new [filter external inputs demo](http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-filter-external-inputs.html).
* Filter reset button clicks will again trigger a `filterReset` event. Fixes [issue #423](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/423).

**Grouping widget**
* Merged in fix for grouping widget + filter widget + child row widget.
  * Updated demo with multi-child column styling.
  * Thanks [Xamamule](https://github.com/Xamamule) in [pull #414](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/pull/414)!
  * This also fixes [issue #422](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/422).
* Renamed variables &amp; cleanup
* Added `group_dateString` function to format the date string for `group-date` header class name.

**Zebra widget**
* Now skips removable rows added by other widgets, more specifically, it skips rows with a `remove-me` class name (set by the `selectorRemove` option).

**Docs updates**
* Added a side menu with search to the main document page.
  * The main documentation page now uses Bootstrap for some styles.
  * Search includes a count with clear search, previous result and next result buttons.
  * Search options included to find letters or whole words only, and choose if the search is case sensitive, or not.
  * The advantage of this search over the browser's built-in search (Ctrl-F) is that this search will find text within the hidden content
  * Indexing of the search results may not always be in order, i.e. "10/10" may not always be the lowest result on the page due to nested elements.
  * Sorry, IE7 and older users, the search works but but is really slow. And the side menu styling leaves much to be desired (using Bootstrap).
* jQuery UI theme selector updates. See [issue #407](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/407).
* Updated typos &amp; css in various demos
* Added Utility options section for options used by parsers, storage utility and pager ajax data.
* Added removed options section.
  * This applies to pager options available in the original version of tablesorter which are no longer supported.
  * Fixes [issue #416](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/416).
* Added `kbd` styling for better visualization of keyboard keys.

**Other**
* Renamed variables within the [pager custom control demo](http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/beta-testing/example-pager-custom-controls.html) (still in beta)
* Renamed variables within default widgets file
  * Utilities: storage, addHeaderResizeEvent,, resizableReset
  * Widgets: columns, resizable, stickyHeaders, uitheme, saveSort
* Updated parser-date-two-digit-year.js to allow changing the date range
  * Set a different date range by adding a value to `table.config.dateRange`.
  * Instructions added to main documents under utility options
* Storage utility (`$.tablesorter.storage`) now accepts a jQuery object as well as a DOM object of the table
  * `$.tablesorter.storage( $('#mytable'), 'myvariable', 'YAY' );`, or
  * `$.tablesorter.storage( $('#mytable')[0], 'myvariable', 'YAY' );`
