TableSorter Change Log

Version 2.0.30 (2012-2-20)
============================

* Fixed the total mess I just made with the addWidget init functionality... I need a vacation :P

Version 2.0.29 (2012-2-20)
============================

* Fixed a problem with the addWidget init function which apparently was always being called, even if you didn't want it! Fix for [issue #28](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/28). Thanks to thezoggy for helping with troubleshooting!
* Minor cleanup of sorting class names code.

Version 2.0.28.1 (2012-2-16)
============================

* Modified the plugin pager to ignore child rows. Fix for [issue #27](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/27).

Version 2.0.28 (2012-2-1)
============================

* Added a new function to widgets called "init" which is called upon initialization, before any of the widgets are applied.
  * I added it to allow the "saveSort" widget to get the saved sort data (localStorage or cookie) before the initial sort was applied.
  * The "saveSort" widget is still compatible with the original tablesorter, but the original version will call all of the widgets twice on initialization, if using the "saveSort" widget.
  * New add widget format is as follows:

        ```javascript
        $.tablesorter.addWidget({
          id: 'myWidget',
          init: function(table, allWidgets, thisWidget){
            // widget initialization code - this is only run ONCE
            // but in this example I call the format function because
            // I want to keep it backwards compatible with the original tablesorter
            thisWidget.format(table, true);
          },
          format: function(table, initFlag) {
            // widget code to apply to the table AFTER EACH SORT
            // the initFlag is true when format is called for the first time, but
            // only if it is called from the init function
          }
        });
        ```

Version 2.0.27 (2012-1-31)
============================

* Added `sortReset` option
  * Setting this option to `true`, allows you to click on the header a third time to clear the sort
  * Clearing the sort DOES NOT return the table to it's initial unsorted state.
* Added `saveSort` widget
  * This widget will save the last sort to local storage, and will fallback to cookies.
  * The widget does use the `JSON.stringify` function which is [not fully supported](http://caniuse.com/#search=json) (IE7), so if you plan to support it and use this widget, please include this [JSON library](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js).
* Fixed pager page size not sticking. Fix for [issue #24](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/24).

Version 2.0.26 (2012-1-30)
============================

* Widgets should no longer be applied twice when an initial sort direction is added. Fix for [issue #21](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/21).
* Modified Green theme:
  * The Green theme sort direction icon is now applied to only the first span it encounters inside the header. The UI theme adds a second span for it's icon.
  * Essentially to fix [this demo](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-ui-theme.html) which allows switching between all of the themes.
* Modified the UI theme to now add a div that wraps all of the header cell content to allow positioning of the sort direction icon.

Version 2.0.25.2 (2012-1-27)
============================

* Changed Blue theme to vertically align arrows. Fix for [issue #12](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/12).
* Fixed sticky header widget so varing width columns now update when the pager plugin changes pages. Thanks to locationRoura for reporting this issue.

Version 2.0.25.1 (2011-12-15)
============================

* Fixed disabled column style for the ui theme widget. Thanks to [bbbco](https://github.com/bbbco) for the fix in [issue #17](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/17).


Version 2.0.25 (2011-12-14)
============================

* The ui theme and sticky header widgets now work together and update the arrow direction. Fix for [issue #15](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/15).
* Empty cells with only a tab or space will now sort at the bottom. Thanks to [pursual](https://github.com/pursual) for the fix for [issue #16](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/16).

Version 2.0.24 (2011-12-12)
============================

* Modified empty cell sorting to always sort at the bottom. Fix for [issue #14](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/14).
* Updated the sticky header widget to line up properly with the UI theme. Fix for [issue #13](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/13).

Version 2.0.23.5 (2011-12-6)
============================

* Updated the sticky header widget again to not interfere with the filter widget. Fix for [issue #10](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/10).

Version 2.0.23.4 (2011-12-6)
============================

* Updated the sticky header widget to reposition the sticky header when scrolling left. Fix for [issue #9](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/9).

Version 2.0.23.3 (2011-11-7)
============================

* Updated the filter widget:
  * Changed filter input from visibility hidden to display none. Fix/enhancement from [issue #7](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/7).
  * Modified the widget to better work with child rows. Added the `widgetFilterChildRows` option. Fix for [issue #8](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/8).
  * When `widgetFilterChildRows` is true, all child row content is included in the row filtering; if false, the child row content is ignored.
* Added `tableClass` to the documents. Apparently I forgot to add it before.
* Added a note to the filter demo bringing up [issue #6](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/6).
* Miscellaneous updates to the documents.

Version 2.0.23.2 (2011-10-28)
============================

* Fixed pager size & total pages not being retained after destroying, then restoring the pager. Thanks to crush123 for reporting the problem!

Version 2.0.23.1 (2011-10-26)
============================

* Fixed the pager plugin to prevent errors when initialized on an empty table. Fix for [issue #5](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/5).
* Added a Resizable Column widget
  * At this time, this widget allows resizing the column widths from the header.
  * The column widths are not saved, but if I did consider saving the widths to local storage. I just didn't get around to doing it.
  * [Demo page](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-resizable.html) added.
* Reorganized the next demo links, located at the bottom of every demo page, to match the order on the main document page.

Version 2.0.23 (2011-10-18)
============================

* Changed the `dateFormat` option:
 * The settings are now "mmddyyyy", "ddmmyyyy", and "yyyymmdd".
 * Changed the date separator to include any of the following: slash, dash, period, comma, space(s) or tab.
 * The date format parser will only work with a four digit year.
 * Added a [demo page](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-option-date-format.html).

Version 2.0.22.1 (2011-10-15)
============================

* Updated the stickyHeaders widget
  * Sticky headers will now resize with the browser window
  * Updated blue and green themes to work better with sticky headers.
  * If using the uitheme widget, make sure the 'uitheme' widget is applied before (left of) the 'stickyHeaders' widget, as follows:

        widgets: ['zebra', 'uitheme', 'stickyHeaders']

Version 2.0.22 (2011-10-13)
============================

* Updated the pager plugin:
  * Fixed a problem that occurred when `removeRows` is set to false - fix for [issue #4](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/4).
  * Added "disable.pager" and "enable.pager" methods to the pager. These are useful if you want to delete a table row with the pager applied.

    // Delete a row
    // this function targets a button with a "remove" class name inside a table row
    // *************
    // Use delegate or live because `removeRows` is set to `true` in the demo - hidden rows don't exist
    $('table').delegate('button.remove', 'click' ,function(){
      var t = $('table');
      // disabling the pager will restore all table rows
      t.trigger('disable.pager');
      // remove the chosen row
      $(this).closest('tr').remove();
      // restore pager
      t.trigger('enable.pager');
    });

  * Fixed the `positionFixed` option (which positions the pager below the table) to now include the `offset` option value.
  * Fixed the pager arrow buttons so that destroying and enabling the pager multiple times doesn't multiply the number of pages changed.
  * Updated the pager demo page to allow deleting rows.
  * General cleanup and added lots of comments in the plugin and demo page on what each pager option does.
* Made one minor change to the tablesorter plugin to accomidate the pager plugin using the `removeRows` option.

Version 2.0.21.1 (2011-10-11)
============================

* Added "stickyHeader" widget to the "jquery.tablesorter.widgets.js" file.
  * This widget makes the header stick to the top of the page while scrolling down.
  * The sticky header is fully functional and will allow you to sort the table.
  * And best of all, it can be applied to the original tablesorter plugin.
  * Thanks to Chris Coyier and his post on [persistent headers](http://css-tricks.com/13465-persistent-headers/).
* Added a compressed widget file named "jquery.tablesorter.widgets.min.js".

Version 2.0.21 (2011-09-22)
============================

* Added `sortBegin` event
  * This event is triggered immediately before the actual sort. So this event occurs after the `sortStart` and after the `sortList` option has been updated.
  * It was added to allow for changing the sort dynamically. See [issue #3](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/3).
* Added `removeRows` option to the pager plugin
  * When `true`, the default value, the pager plugin removes all non-active rows from the table. This greatly increases the sort speed of large tables.
  * When `false`, the pager plugin merely hides the non-active rows so they all continue to exist in the table. This should allow for better access to data within the table (i.e. submitting form elements)

Version 2.0.20.1 (2011-09-16)
============================

* Oops fixed currency sorting

Version 2.0.20 (2011-09-16)
============================

* Filter Widget
  * Added "filter" to the "headers" option to allow disabling the filter option for a specific column - thanks jizo!
  * Added "filter-false" class, that when applied will disable the filter widget for that column.
  * Updated the headers docs and the filter widget demo.
* Updated the currency parser to use unicode characters to better work in different document formats.

Version 2.0.19 (2011-09-16)
============================

* Added code in attempt to clear the table headers between multiple tables - fix for [issue #2](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/2).
* Cleaned up some code and wrapped the widget code to prevent conflicts with other javascript libraries.
* Updated the columns widget:
  * Added css examples to the [demo](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-columns.html).
  * Removed the `widgetColumns` option from the core, but it is still used by the widget - the way it is used hasn't changed.
* Updated the uitheme widget:
  * Added `widgetUitheme` option - used by the widget, but not included in the core. See the demo for a better example.
  * Example added to the [uitheme widget demo](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-columns.html).

Version 2.0.18.1 (2011-09-14)
============================

* Updated the "uitheme" widget with method to add zebra striping and hovered header classes.

Version 2.0.18 (2011-09-13)
============================

* Fixed a bug in the column widget, it would cause an error if no initial sort was set.
* Fixed a bug where an error would occur if a widget doesn't exist.
* Updated pager widget to allow restoring the pager plugin & updated demo.
* Added column filter widget. It is designed so that each column has an filter.

Version 2.0.17 (2011-09-11)
============================

* Added a jquery.tablesorter.widget.js file:
  * It contains the "uitheme" widget, to add any jQuery UI theme, and the new "columns" widget, to style columns.
  * The blue and green themes have been updated with the added styles from the columns widget.
  * Added a Columns Widget demo and instructions.
* Added a `widgetColumns` option which defines the css classes added by the columns widget.
* Added notes to the pager plugin demo page to better specify when a change was added.
* The green theme header images have been modified to better work with variable width tables.

Version 2.0.16 (2011-09-08)
============================

* Added notes to demo pages to indicate if the original (version 2.0.5, at [tablesorter.com](http://tablesorter.com/docs/)) does have that option or method.
* Added "addRows" method that allows adding table rows.
  * This method differs from the "update" method in that it only adds rows to the cache.
  * Use this new method to add rows to a table with the pager plugin applied. Using the "update" method on a table with the pager plugin will remove all hidden rows from the cache.
* Added a "destroy.pager" method to remove the pager from the table - pager demo updated.

Version 2.0.15 (2011-08-23)
============================

* Fixed a problem that caused a javascript error when a table header cell doesn't have a class name.

Version 2.0.14 (2011-08-22)
============================

* Reverted the changes made in 2.0.13 and added checks to prevent errors.
* Allowed sorting an empty table which would then automatically sort its contents when the table is updated.
* Modified "Update" and "UpdateCell" methods to automatically resort the table using the existing sort.
* Updated the [Initializing tablesorter on an empty table](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-empty-table.html) demo and [Updating a table cell](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-update-cell.html).

Version 2.0.13 (2011-08-19)
============================

* Fixed a problem where a javascript error would occur when initializing a multi sort on an empty table. Thanks again to Eugene Ivakhiv!

Version 2.0.12 (2011-08-19)
============================

* Updated the `textExtraction` functionality
   * The original textExtraction function was only able to be applied to all the cells in the table.
   * Apparently the ability to define textExtraction on a per column basis was misinterpreted by me, so now I've added it.
   * Use the option as follows:

     $("table").tablesorter({
       textExtraction: {
         0: function(node) { return $(node).find(selector1).text(); },
         1: function(node) { return $(node).find(selector2).text(); },
         // etc
       }
     });

   * Updated the [Dealing with markup inside cells](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-option-text-extraction.html) demo.
   * Thanks to Eugene Ivakhiv for reporting this issue to my attention in my blog.


Version 2.0.11 (2011-08-04)
============================

* Added the ability to set a column parser using a class name
   * When setting the parser, start the class name with "sorter-" followed by the parser name, e.g. "sorter-text" or "sorter-digit"
   * The column can be disabled by setting the class name to "sorter-false"
   * [Demo page](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-parsers-class-name.html) included.
   * Custom parsers can also be used - see the updated [writing custom parsers demo](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-parsers.html).

Version 2.0.10 (2011-07-31)
============================

* Modified the numeric sort with a new method to deal with non-numeric content:
   * When sorting columns with numeric values, by default any non-numeric or empty cells are treated as if they have a zero value. This puts the text between negative and positive values in a column.
   * Adding `string : "max+"` to the `headers` option will now treat any non-numeric table cells as if they have a maxiumum positive value (a value greater than the maximum positive value in the column).
   * Adding `string : "max-"` to the `headers` option will now treat any non-numeric table cells as if they have a maxiumum negative value (a value greater than the maximum negative value in the column).
   * See the "[Dealing with text strings in numeric sorts](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-options-headers-digits-strings.html)" demo for a better visual example.
* Changed UI theme widget code to use "ui-widget-header" instead of "ui-widget-default" to better match the themes.
* Renamed changelog.markdown to changelog.txt to prevent downloading when clicking on the link

Version 2.0.9 (2011-07-27)
============================

* Added a jQuery UI theme and widget example. To apply the jQuery UI theme:
   * Include any jQuery UI theme on your page.
   * Add the base tablesorter ui theme (located in css/ui directory)
   * Add the jQuery UI theme widget code found on [this example page](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-ui-theme.html). This demo page includes the UI theme switcher.
* Added a header index to the `onRenderHeader` function to make it easier to target specific header cells for modification. See the [render header example](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-option-render-header.html) for an example.
* Pager plugin updates:
   * Removed the `separator` option and added an `output` option which allows you to completely customize the output string.
   * In the `output` string, include any of the following variables:
      * `{page}` is replaced with the current page number.
      * `{totalPages}` is replaced with the total number of pages.
      * `{startRow}` is replaced with the number of the visible start row of the pager.
      * `{endRow}` is replaced with the number of the visible end row of the pager.
      * `{totalRows}` is replaced with the total number of rows.
   * The `cssPageDisplay` option can now target any element; in previous versions, this element was an input of type text.
   * Added a `pagerArrows` and `cssDisabled` options:
      * When `pagerArrows` is true, the first and previous pager arrows have the css class name contained in the `cssDisabled` option applied when the first row is visible.
      * The next and last pager arrows will be have the `cssDisabled` class applied when the last row is visible.
      * Additionally, if the number of table rows is less than the pager size, the pager will get the `cssDisabled` class name applied.
      * If false (the default setting), the pager arrows class names will not change.
      * Please see the updated [pager demo](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-pager.html) to see this working.

Version 2.0.8 (2011-07-21)
============================

* Fixed parsers for currency and digits to work with number values separated by commas. Thanks to Josh Renaud for the information!
* Fixed "lockedOrder" header option and added documentation and an example on how to use it.
* Made the sort order "desc" only trigger off of the first letter, so any word/abbreviation starting with "d" will set the descending sort order, all other letters will set the order to ascending (shhh, because I'm a bad speller :P)
* Modified the "sortInitialOrder" option so it can also be set in the headers option.

Version 2.0.7 (2011-07-17)
============================

* Added "pagerChange" and "pagerComplete" events to the pager plugin which trigger on the table. See the [pager demo](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-pager.html) for an example on how to bind to them.
* Added the "sortAppend" since the option was there, but apparently the code wasn't.
* Added missing documentation from [my blog post](http://wowmotty.blogspot.com/2011/06/jquery-tablesorter-missing-docs.html)
 * This included a few new example pages: apply widgets, child rows, render header, sort append and zebra widget.
 * Added a methods and events table.
* Fixed the minified version. Apparently sorting functions called by the eval were removed by the Google Closure Compiler. Resolved by using "Whitespace only" optimization.
* Fixed syntax highlighting; updated Chili.

Version 2.0.6 (2011-06-22)
============================

* Forked original files and docs from [tablesorter.com](http://tablesorter.com) to GitHub.
* Replaced alphabetical sort with an alphanumeric sort
 * This "slower" sort can be disabled by setting the `sortLocaleCompare` option to `true`
 * The `sortLocaleCompare` option's default was changed to `false`.
 * Added a very basic demo.
* Added `tableClass` option
 * The value is "tablesorter" by default and should no longer be required in the default markup.
 * This class is applied to the table in the script and should match the css styling.
* Each header cell now has its content wrapped with a span.
 * This allows applying the direction icon to the span instead of the entire cell.
 * Although, this might just be extra markup with the advent of multiple background images and gradient backgrounds available in CSS3.
* Reformatted the code to make jSLint "happier".

Version 2.0.5b (?)
============================

* General
 * Added "cssChildRow" option - attach a child row to its parent.
 * Added "sortLocaleCompare" to use the native `String.localeCampare` method during text sort.
 * Added "onRenderHeader" function that is called when classes are added to the header cells.
 * Added "selectorHeaders" option to target the the header cells.
 * Changed multisort function

Version 2.0.3 (2008-03-17)
============================

* Bug fixes - Missing semicolon, broke the minified version.

Version 2.0.2 (2008-03-14)
============================

* General
 * Added support for the new metadata plugin.
 * Added support for jQuery 1.2.3.
 * Added support for decimal numbers and negative and positive digits.
 * Updated documenation and website with new examples.
 * Removed packed version.

* Bug fixes
 * Sort force (Thanks to David Lynch).

Version 2.0.1 (2007-09-17)
============================

* General
 * Removed the need for Dimensions plugin when using the pagnation plugin thanks to offset being included in the jQuery 1.2 core.
 * Added support for jQuery 1.2.
 * Added new Minified version of tablesorter.
 * Updated documenation and website with new examples.

* Bug fixes
 * If row values are identical the original order is kept (Thanks to David hull).
 * If thead includes a table $('tbody:first', table) breaks (Thanks to David Hull).

* Speed improvements:
 * appendToTable, setting innerHTML to "" before appending new content to table body.
 * zebra widget. (Thanks to James Dempster).
